# Deep Learning Solutions - Arewa Data Science Academy

## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to the weekly exercises from the **Arewa Data Science Academy's Deep Learning Cohort 2.0** program. The exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience with PyTorch and cover a range of topics, from foundational tensor operations to advanced deep learning tasks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and classification models. Each week's solution builds upon the previous, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of deep learning concepts and their practical applications.

## Process
The following steps were followed to complete the exercises across the weeks:

1. **Week 1 - Foundational PyTorch Operations**:
   - Explored tensor creation, matrix multiplication, and GPU utilization.
   - Managed random seeds for reproducibility and performed advanced tensor manipulations.

2. **Week 2 - Linear Regression**:
   - Implemented a linear regression model using PyTorch.
   - Created a dataset, built a custom model, trained it, and saved/loaded the model for inference.

3. **Week 3 - Classification Models**:
   - Built binary and multi-class classification models using PyTorch.
   - Created synthetic datasets, trained models, and visualized decision boundaries.

4. **Week 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
   - Implemented a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
   - Trained the model on both CPU and GPU, evaluated its performance, and visualized results.

## Tech Tools
The following tools and technologies were used throughout the project:
- **Python**: The programming language used for all implementations.
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used for building and training models.
- **Torchvision**: Used for loading and transforming datasets.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used for generating synthetic datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: A library used for visualizing data, predictions, and decision boundaries.
- **TorchMetrics**: Used for calculating metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing and running Python code.
- **Google Colab**: (Optional) For running notebooks on GPU-enabled environments.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating deep learning models using PyTorch. By completing these exercises, a solid understanding of PyTorch's functionalities and deep learning concepts was achieved. The outcomes include trained models for regression, binary classification, multi-class classification, and image classification tasks. These skills serve as a foundation for more advanced deep learning projects.
