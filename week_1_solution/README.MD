# Week 1 Solution - Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Introduction
This notebook contains solutions to the Week 1 exercises from the **Arewa Data Science Academy's Deep Learning Cohort 1.0** program. The exercises focus on foundational PyTorch operations, including tensor creation, matrix multiplication, random seed management, GPU utilization, and tensor manipulation. These tasks are designed to build a strong understanding of PyTorch's core functionalities.

## Process
The following steps were followed to complete the exercises:
1. **Importing PyTorch**: The notebook begins by importing the PyTorch library and verifying its version.
2. **Tensor Operations**: Random tensors are created, and operations such as matrix multiplication and reshaping are performed.
3. **Random Seed Management**: The `torch.manual_seed()` function is used to ensure reproducibility of results. GPU-specific random seed management is also explored.
4. **GPU Utilization**: Tensors are sent to the GPU for computation, and operations are performed to validate GPU functionality.
5. **Advanced Tensor Manipulations**: Tasks such as finding maximum/minimum values, indices, and removing singleton dimensions are implemented.

Each task is documented with markdown cells explaining the problem and the corresponding solution.

## Tech Tools
The following tools and technologies were used in this notebook:
- **Python**: The programming language used for all implementations.
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used for tensor operations and GPU acceleration.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing and running Python code.
- **Google Colab**: (Optional) For running the notebook on a GPU-enabled environment.

## Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates the foundational operations in PyTorch, including tensor creation, matrix multiplication, and GPU utilization. By completing these exercises, a solid understanding of PyTorch's basic functionalities is achieved, which serves as a stepping stone for more advanced deep learning tasks.
